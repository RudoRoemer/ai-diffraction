## Crystal-to-Diffraction Pattern via Machine Learning


*by Joe Webb*

ai-diffraction is a machine learning approach to diffraction patterns. It serves as a proof of concept that the field of microscopy can be greatly aided by the use of machine learning: electron diffraction experiments are expensive, existing computational methods are time-consuming, and machine learning has the benefit of being neither.
